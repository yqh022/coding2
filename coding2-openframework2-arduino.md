# coding2-openframework2-arduino

This project combines open frameworks and Arduino. I transmitted the potentiometer values through Adurino. It changes the number and color of the cubes by changing the value of the potentiometer. It can also change the brightness of the bulb by transmitting data. In the bottom half of the screen, you can see the changed values. The cube is random and the viewpoint can be changed with the mouse.
