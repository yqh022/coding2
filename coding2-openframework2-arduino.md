# coding2-openframework2-arduino
In this project combining open framework and Arduino I transferred the value of the potentiometer and changed the number and color of the cubes 
by changing the value to change the brightness of the bulb. In the bottom half of the screen, you can see the changing  values. The cubes change
randomly and the view can be changed with the mouse.
