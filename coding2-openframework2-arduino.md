# coding2-openframework2-arduino
This project combines the open framework and Arduino.   I transferred the value of the potentiometer and changed the number and color of the cube by changing the value of the potentiometer.   It also transmits data to change the brightness of the bulbs.   In the bottom half of the screen, you can see the changed values.   The cube is random and the angle of view can be changed with the mouse.
